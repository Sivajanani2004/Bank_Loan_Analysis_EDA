# Bank Loan Analysis (EDA Project)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to understand borrower behavior, loan distribution, and factors contributing to loan defaults. The analysis is done using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

- Features include: Loan status, annual income, grade, purpose, employment details, debt-to-income ratio, payment history, etc.  
- Source: Provided dataset (confidential)  

## Key Analysis
- Loan distribution by grade, purpose, home ownership, and state  
- Relationship between annual income, DTI (Debt-to-Income ratio), and loan status  
- Time-based analysis of loan issuances and defaults  
- Borrower profiles and risk assessment  

## Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- Jupyter Notebook
